# Quartz
Quartz is a lightweight frontend web framework that is designed to make the frontend of web application development easy.  Quartz includes a grid system for responsive development, along with some basic text styles, and a few other useful components.

# Status
Quartz is currently in those painfully early stages of development, so I wouldn't recommend using it yet.  I would star it though and keep your eye out for changes!
