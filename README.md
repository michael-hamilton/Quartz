# Quartz
Quartz is a lightweight frontend web framework that is designed to make the frontend of web application development easy.  Quartz includes a grid system for responsive development, along with some basic text styles, and a few other useful components.

# Status
Quartz is just a simple collection of frontend utilities that I have put together so that I don't have to turn to Bootstrap for a simple project.  If I start a project using Quartz and something is missing, I try to add it.  If you start a project and feel that something is missing, feel free to add it!  Or at least submit a feature request on the [GitHub](https://github.com/michael-hamilton/Quartz) page.
