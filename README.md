# Quartz
Quartz is a lightweight frontend web framework that is designed to make the frontend of web application development easy.  Quartz includes a grid system for responsive development, along with some basic text styles, and a few other useful components.

# Status
Quartz is currently in those painfully early stages of development, so I wouldn't recommend using it yet.  I would star it though and keep your eye out for changes!

# Installation
Quartz can be used by cloning the repository as so:
```
git clone https://github.com/michael-hamilton/Quartz.git
```

#License
Quartz is released under [the MIT license](https://github.com/michael-hamilton/Quartz/blob/master/LICENSE).  Have fun with it.

#Acknowledgement
Quartz is developed with love by [Michael Hamilton](https://github.com/michael-hamilton)
